/***************** LAB ASSIGNMENT 5 ********************/
Created on MAC OS X

Building design is roughly based on temple of hephaestus (greek architecture)
textures are also used to create flower bed and water pool/fountain

/**********  TRANSFORMATIONS + PRIMITIVES *************/

Translations and rotations are used all the time for this graphic.
For example, Translations are used to place all the columns for the building.
Rotations are used to create the roof of the building and the inner section


/********** METHOD MODIFICATIONS *************/

modified init() to include water texture;
Also  changed length of texture array to allow for additional water texture addition

modified drawMyHouse() to include drawings


/********** COOL THINGS *************/
My favourite part about this project was creating the columns for the building. I also really liked the freedom of being able to use textures to create the scene. There are now infinite possibilities in the look of the scene that you want.

The cool thing about this drawing is that the outer column rectangle in the building has the exact number of columns as outer columns of the temple of hephaestus in real life.

Another cool fact is that 7 different textures are used to create the scene- 3 for the building, one for the land, one for the base of the pool and flower bed, and one each additional for the pool and flower bed. The texture of the columns was specifically oriented to give the look that is displayed
