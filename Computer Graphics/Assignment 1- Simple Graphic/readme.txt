/***************** LAB ASSIGNMENT 1 ********************/

The drawing is of a Yin Yang with a fractal tree design within.

/**********  TRANSFORMATIONS + PRIMITIVES *************/

The transformations that were used to draw this object include translations, rotations, and scaling.
The ying yang uses translations to draw different circles that form the whole symbol.
The fractal tree uses translations, rotations, and scaling. For each iteration of the tree fork a stem line is drawn followed by two translated, scaled, and rotated branches. This recursive effect results in the design within the Yin Yang.

/********** METHOD MODIFICATIONS *************/

The only modified method is display()

/********** COOL THINGS *************/
My favourite part about creating this drawing was figuring out how to design the Yin Yang.
It seems complicated when initially looking at the symbol- but then the realisation is that the symbol can be created only using circles and semi- circles.

Another cool thing is that each inner circle of the yin yang is stemmed from a fractal tree


/********** NOTES *************/

You should zoom in to see the symbol properly
