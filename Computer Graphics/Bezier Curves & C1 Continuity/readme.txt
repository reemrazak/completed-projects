/***************** LAB ASSIGNMENT 4 ********************/

Saved drawing is a flower made of yin yangs with randomly generated colours

/**********  TRANSFORMATIONS + PRIMITIVES *************/

Translations and rotations are only used when drawing tangent lines and objects.
When drawing the bezier curve translations are not necessary because the exact coordinates are captured and calculated for each point

/********** METHOD MODIFICATIONS *************/

The only modified method is display() and keyboard

/********** COOL THINGS *************/
My favourite part about creating this drawing was actually drawing the bezier curves.
I think it’s very cool that we learned how to create bezier curves- i now understand what is going on when using the bezier tool in Adobe Photoshop and other graphic editors.

An additional feature i added is generating random colour for my object to give a more colourful look to the drawing. New colours are generated every time the user presses a key… this is for a “disco effect” :)- for example hold down space bar and the colours will continue to change
