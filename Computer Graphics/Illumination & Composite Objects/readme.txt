/***************** LAB ASSIGNMENT 3 ********************/

Drawing 2 (Primitive Drawing) is a simple Torus 
Drawing 3 is called AlienButterfly and is a complex pattern of spheres and toruses which resembles a butterfly shape
Drawing 4 is called ComplexCylinder and is a cylinder frame constructed using spheres and toruses

/**********  TRANSFORMATIONS + PRIMITIVES *************/

Drawing of the primitive was simple plotting vertices.
For the AlienButterfly and ComplecCylinder transformations that were used to draw the objects included 3d translations, rotations, and scaling.

The alien butterfly uses recursion- mainly rotations for each branch and then translation and rotation for the sub branches

The complexCylinder uses rotations WITHIN each layer- and each layer is simply created by translating a copy

/********** METHOD MODIFICATIONS *************/

The only modified method is display()

/********** COOL THINGS *************/
My favourite part about creating this drawing was figuring out how to design the Yin Yang.
It seems complicated when initially looking at the symbol- but then the realisation is that the symbol can be created only using circles and semi- circles.

Another cool thing is that each inner circle of the yin yang is stemmed from a fractal tree
